## Contributing to Time Themes Project

Hi, Hello and Welcome. Thank you for considering to contributing to Time Theme open source project! You'd make a great impact in the community!

Reading the guigelines below would make your contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved in it.

## Pull Requests

PRs are always welcome and are a quick way to get a fix or improvement. Ideally the PR should :

- Only fix/add the functionality in question OR address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first.

In general

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone to your machine
3. Create a local branch
4. Commit and push to your fork
5. Open a PR so that we can review the changes.

##### Thank you once again and your contrubutions are valued!
